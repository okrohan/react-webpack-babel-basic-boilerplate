#Getting Started

* Make Sure you have Node with NPM or YARN installed
* Clone the Repository on your Local machine using : "git clone https://github.com/okrohan/react-webpack-babel-basic-boilerplate.git" or paste the ssh if you prefer.
  Also you can just download the repo as zip
* Open the Directory and Install All the dependencies : "npm install";
* Thats it!, test it using webpack-dev-server run : "npm start"
* That should start the webpack-dev-server on localhost:3000
* Browse src/index.js to change the entry point of your react app
* A Demo component "hello-world.jsx" should be present in src/components
